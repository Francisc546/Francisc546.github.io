We developed two preliminary prototypes with distinct approaches to the gameplay design, 
while maintaining the same narrative, this allowed us to compare key elements within our artifact.

Both prototypes followed the same storyline: The game began with foxes playing together when an elder fox introducing them to an object, 
leading them on a journey to find more. Upon retrieving the object, they returned home to present it to their family. 
However, at this moment, our protagonist fox was rejected in comparison to the others.

Fast-forward, the game transitioned to a scene where the foxes were sleeping. 
Our fox, now ostracized and isolated, struggled to sleep, visibly shaking. 
Eventually, the fox wakes up and leaves. As the journey continued, the fox stumbled upon an oasis — but upon reaching it, they drowned, 
nly to wake up and realize it was merely a dream. The fox was actually struggling to breathe, with a tumbleweed stuck in its nose. 
Determined, it decided to follow the tumbleweed, which led to the onset of a sandstorm. 
At this stage, players were tasked with finding shelter, guiding them to a tunnel system—a maze-like environment where 
they had to locate the foxes' den.

Prototype A:

This was the prototype we leaned towards a more abstract approach, hoping users were intrinsically engaged with the experience of a story centered around foxes. Unlike the other prototype, this version did not include any direct narrative explanations, players watched the cinematic sequences and interpreted the story on their own
To enhance player agency, we allowed the player to control the fox earlier in this prototype, whereas the alternative version featured a longer cinematic sequence before granting control. Later, players experienced a three-phase repetition of walking through the environment at different times of the day
his design choice reinforced the passage of time, as the player could choose their direction while exploring, that was inspired by the idea of having the game more similar to a walking simulator
Lastly, since this version provided a more relaxed gameplay experience, we wanted players to immerse themselves in the world through the perspective of a fox. To enhance this, we introduce the ability to dig, a natural behavior of four-legged animals, where we believe that digging would be the most fitting gameplay mechanic for this melodramatic and cinematographic experience

Prototype B:
Followed a more traditional game structure in its design.
Unlike prototype A, this version included a narration of the cinematic sequences 
Additionally instead of granting players immediate agency to control the fox and walk it to the first challenge, as in prototype A, we opted to start the game directly at the challenge location, following a longer cinematic introduction.

To create a more structured and problem solving experience, we introduced puzzle-solving challenges that require players to engage their problem solving skills to surpass obstacles and solve puzzles. As result, this version followed a more linear progress, with participants always having a clear indication of where to go,
instead of the freedom of exploring given in  prototype A.
Since this version aimed to capture players attention and engagement level through the use of cognitive challenges,
we designed the first challenge as a jumping sequence across falling platforms,
where players had to retrieve an object and later in the prototype the player would have to find a way to open a door, to get to the destination requested.
