### Masters Against FoodWaste

**Type: Game**

Mobile game developed for my MSc Thesis, the itention was to develop an accessible game for the Local Foodbank to share with children
in their school visits. A narrative targetting kids from 8 to 12 years old, with minimalistic graphics and assets, includes character 
customization and trophies for a sense of progression. The game consists of a topdown view of a restaurant and we control a young monkey,
we have different challenges, which are performed in first person point of view, that help the players learn more about food waste.
